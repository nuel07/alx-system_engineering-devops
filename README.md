System Engineering and DevOps - Bash, Scripting, Web Stack/Web Stack Debugging, Networking & Security, CI/CD

This repository contains programs written for the system engineering and DevOps track during the software engineering program
at ALX-Africa. In these projects, I worked with Bash and practiced writing Bash scripts to automate tasks. I learned about
the OSI model and various Linux networking tools. Further, I configured a distributed system - two web servers and one
load balancer - for deployment of my AirBnB_clone project using Nginx, HAProxy, certbot, ufw, and MySQL.
