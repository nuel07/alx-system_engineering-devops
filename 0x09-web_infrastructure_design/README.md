In this project, I went behind the scenes of web development in order to better understand how the web applications work and how to handle and avoid possible failures.
I got more insight on domain names, web servers, application servers and actual physical servers, HTTPS and how its different from HTTP.
Understanding how the web stack works was the main goal.
